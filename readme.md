# Awesome Onion Links [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://awesome.re)
Yeah so I kind of forgot about this, read the FAQ for more info.

# FAQ (February 17, 2025 Update)
>where have you been?

I've been focusing on university for the last several years, I pretty much started this project during the 2020 pandemic where I had very little to do back then, but now times have changed.

>what happened to the links?

I removed the links because the vast majority of them still used the v2 address format which Tor has dropped support for since 2022 in favor of their V3 address format. Plus links constantly go down all the time and keeping it updated would've been very time consuming.

>are you going to come back to this project?

I'm not sure, I'm pretty sure I was violating Github's ToS, so my account would probably been banned eventually. I am focused on other things in my life at the moment so this is a low priority for me

>where can I find links now?

[dark.fail](https://dark.fail) has verified links, so I would start there.

I will at least leave Onion search engines are still running as of February 17, 2025. These hopefully shouldn't violate Github's ToS.

As before, you will need to use [Tor Browser](https://torproject.org) or you can use a service like [Tor2Web](https://tor2web.nl)
