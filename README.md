# Disclaimer
I only provide information about what exists on the dark web as informative/educational purposes only. I have listed many onion links that are still up and running with a legitimate purpose.

Few onion links might be a scam, phishing, or contain illegal activities like drugs, weapons, illegal markets, fraudulent services, stolen data, etc., and many more. These activities may involve you at risk in danger by unknowingly. Kindly be aware of such activities which may take you and put yourself under risk.

I am not involved in any practices like described above and if you wish to surf the dark web you are the only solely responsible for your activity. Any misleads or dealing with illegal markets accessed by you will end up in a bad situation.

Know your risk before opening any onion links, if you the link is legal then you can enjoy surfing and know more about the dark web or else learn about dark web before accessing it. Use a good VPN to stay away from danger and your risk factor will be very less.
